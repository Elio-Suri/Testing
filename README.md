# Project: Automated Ultrasound Scoring of Joint Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a long term autoimmune disorder that mainly affects joints and leads to warm, swollen, and painful joints. This project aim to develop a software that can assist skilled physician in analyzing ultrasound images of metacarpophalangeal joints and metatarsophalangeal joints.

## Description
Exploring 2 different methods:
- Conventional segmentation
- Unet model

## Software requirement

### Conventional
MATLAB
### Unet
Python

## Navigating through the files

### Folders
- **Conventional**: MATLAB coding for conventional segmentation
- **Data_sample**: sample image (Batch: Feb 2019, Apr 2019)
- **Results**: results of Unet based on Feb 2019 batch dataset
- **Unet**: Python coding for Unet model
- **Weights**: Weight value used in conventional segmentation

### Running the code
#### Conventional segmentation
_Training model_
1. Open the folder 'Conventional'
